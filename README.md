***(Note : The blue ball is called grain while the black ball is called Intruder)***

The image above is a phenomena called Brazil nut Effect. In this notebook, we are going to build a machine learning model to predict the output of Brazil Nut Effect Phenomena. The aim of this project is to know the intruder final height after the system is shaken for 10s. The output of this dataset is ranging from A to C. A is when the intruder is on top and C is the intruder does not move from its initial position
